The program implements a simple shell (command-line interpreter), which supports the following operations: 
1. Receive commands from the user.
2. Interpret the commands, and use the operating system to help starting up programs and processes requested by the user.
3. Manage process execution (e.g. run processes in the background, suspend them, etc.), using the operating system's services.
